# meta4d-continual-learning
A PyTorch framework for homeostatic neural networks that mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Implements a 4D Meta-Controller regulating topology via Lyapunov stability and Hebbian-guided neurogenesis. Achieves +12% backward transfer on Permuted MNIST by dynamically spawning/pruning block-sparse weights while protecting synaptic memory traces.
